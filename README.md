# klorksZMKcase
A wireless KLOR ks-27/33 case, modified from sadekbaroudis original (found at https://github.com/sadekbaroudi/keyboard-cases/tree/master/KLOR). Much like his case, this uses M2 heat insets and countersunk screws.


This is designed to use 2 of these batteries: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPBXKB82  - the advantage here is that you can charge them directly with USB-C through the side of the case, rather than relying on the much slower charging through the nice!nano v2. These measure slightly shorter than the 18650 STEP file I found on the internet, and the space for the battery in the case is sized accordingly. If you intend to use a different battery, please measure and adjust as necessary. 


And you salvage the battery contacts from these: https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Keystone-Electronics/1042P?qs=g2rIOKKlpoboHyq0g1zn1A%3D%3D&countryCode=US&currencyCode=USD  (or similar, but the case is designed for these contacts to be press fit after you clip off the footing). Be careful when you cut these apart, the vinyl holds a lot of stress/strain and the pieces will *fly*.


Thin wire is also required to solder the battery contacts to the KLOR board. Otherwise, assembly should be straight-forward and follow the original cases format. 


Note that the haptic module being installed makes the bottom plate not sit flush, which will be corrected in a future revision.
