# klorksZMKcase
A wireless KLOR ks-27/33 case, modified from sadekbaroudis original (found at https://github.com/sadekbaroudi/keyboard-cases/tree/master/KLOR)
This is designed to use these batteries: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPBXKB82
And you salvage the battery contacts from these: https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Keystone-Electronics/1042P?qs=g2rIOKKlpoboHyq0g1zn1A%3D%3D&countryCode=US&currencyCode=USD
(they have to be trimmed but should otherwise press-fit into the case in the right place)
Thin wire is also required to solder the battery contacts to the KLOR board.
